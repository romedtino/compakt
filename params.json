Don't miss any more buried messages. Reduce clutter on the screen.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/twy-K8oruDc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Compresses repeated words e.g. \"kappa kappa kappa\" = \"kappa x3\"\r\n* Compresses repeated emotes similar to how words are compressed.\r\n* Repeated messages are grouped together.\r\n* Hover to see a list of all the users who uttered the same message.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n* Just install and visit a Twitch stream to see it in action.\r\n* (Options menu coming soon!)\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\nPull requests always welcome!\r\n\r\n### Developing\r\nThis repository itself is an unpacked extension (with some extra unnecessary files like this readme...).\r\nSo all that needs to be done to develop with Compakt is:\r\n\r\n1. Download/clone the repository into a local folder.\r\n2. [Load the extension into Chrome.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)\r\n\r\n### Publishing\r\nThe \"official\" Chrome Extension is published [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-compakt/gfjfndigkjbiabgckjpngijjdkmebeje?hl=en-US). Official pushes of this repo to the Chrome Web Store are done as needed.\r\n\r\n### Trello\r\nSome development discussion/planning/designing are done on [Trello](https://trello.com/compakt). Feel free to message us to get added! Trello is not required for contributions: you can still just submit pull requests :)\r\n",
